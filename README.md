HUG-Fashion-Websites Terraform + Netlify Deployment
Overview

This project demonstrates how to deploy a static website on Netlify using Terraform, with Terraform Cloud (HCP) remote state.

The setup is fully reproducible â€” anyone can clone the repo, set their token, and deploy the site.

The static site is minimal but fully functional, using HTML, CSS, and JS in the site/ folder.
