HUG-Fashion-Websites Terraform + Netlify Deployment
Overview

This project demonstrates how to deploy a static website on Netlify using Terraform, with Terraform Cloud (HCP) remote state.

The setup is fully reproducible â€” anyone can clone the repo, set their token, and deploy the site.

The static site is minimal but fully functional, using HTML, CSS, and JS in the site/ folder.

Prerequisites:

Terraform â‰¥ 1.5.0

Terraform Cloud account

Workspace: hug-fashion-websites

Netlify account

Personal access token (keep it secret)

GitHub repository

Linked to Netlify for automatic deployment



``` Terraform Cloud Setup:

Navigate to your Terraform Cloud workspace: hug-fashion-websites

Go to Variables â†’ Environment Variables.

Add the following:

Key	                 Value	                Sensitive
netlify_api_token	<your Netlify token>	âœ… Yes

Terraform Cloud will automatically use this token during runs.


``` Netlify Configuration

Base directory: leave empty

Publish directory: site/

Build command: leave empty (static site)

Functions directory: leave default

Push changes to your GitHub repo â€” Netlify will automatically build and deploy your site.

this push to github is one step, but the challenge said we should your apply screenshot so with the 

push to github and pipeline automating deployment means your workspace is set to remote state (VCS)

so advice your set your workspace to cli execution mode. with this you, you run your terraform init, 

terraform plan, and terraform apply from local cli.

Note: to use local cli, your will have create an API token in terraform cloud, and run terraform login 

to link both local cli to terraform cloud.
